 Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the dataset's structure, including data 
types, missing values, and initial summary statistics. 

 To enhance the dataset's analytical capabilities, I created new columns. 

 Finally I designed an interactive and visually appealing dashboard within Power BI.
